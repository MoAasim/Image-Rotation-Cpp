# Image-Rotation-Cpp
To rotate JPEG image using libjpeg library

There is only one requirement that libjpeg v9 should be installed on the system to build
and use the image rotation utility function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made this utility function just to help others, who are trying to do image rotation 
using the libjpep library in C/C++ languages. As i couldn't find anywhere on the internet,
the code of rotating image in C/C++ (maybe i am bad at searching). So, just to help, i made 
this repo.
